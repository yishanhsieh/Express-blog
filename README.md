# Express-blog

## Motivation
I admit Medium and Wordpress are both great and easy, but as product-designer-to-be, it is even better to own my own blog. Most importantly, it is much cheaper in a long-term.

## Design

## Contributions
As a beginner, I took lots of reference from youtube tutorials and combined essential parts from different tutorials into my blog.
